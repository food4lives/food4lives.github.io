# Food4Lives!!!!
Food for Lives is an organization, working to focus on underserved and low-resourced communities. Volunteers play a vital role in our efforts to end hunger in the United States.

## Problem Statement
The need of the organization is to have a custom platform that can be customized as opposed to using several existing platforms. Currently, the organization is facing an issue where they have many accounts on various platforms such as Instagram, Clubhouse, Facebook and Slack. Additionally, they reach 1000 people a month through texting via WhatsApp and it is hard to foster community. Having their own platform means that people will be unified on one platform and will have full visibility in the circle as opposed to coordinating across the platform. 

Every time volunteers go to distribute food, they also want to share their location so that other volunteers can just follow them. People who cook food may not have ever met the people who they serve to. They give their time and never see anyone eat the food. Even sending the pictures up the chain, they struggle and pictures don’t reach them and still they serve. Additionally, this app will help volunteers communicate as they are distributing food on the grounds.

## Proposed Solution / Project Solution
Create an App for returning Volunteers to coordinate and interact with the service community in Food4Lives. This platform will help maintain consistent and meaningful communication with past volunteers and prospective volunteers. The users of the app will be volunteers who want to make a commitment to this organization and the app will help them feel engaged.

The features in the app will consist of a social media feed, a chat section, the user’s profile and a way to access the same information provided on the website such as engaging donations. Overall, provide a medium and forum for volunteers to observe their contributions to the organization so they can view their impact.  

## Incorporating Feedback
We will schedule weekly meetings with our partner organization contact, Powell Harris. During these meetings on Tuesday at 7pm, we will ask for feedback and provide status on the app and incorporate their feedback iteratively. Additionally, we will request feedback from our TA, Shivam Rustogi, as well during his office hours. 

## Software Development Life Cycle 
Our plan for development is to utilize Github as our repository. We already created an organization account called food4lives. Our work items will be tracked in Github and our commits will be pull requests, which will be reviewed by other members of the team. In evaluation, the team will test the application and volunteers can test during the beta release. We will work with the partner organization to deploy the apps to the app store.

## Initial Design Architecture
We are using Flutter for the frontend and AWS Amplify for the backend. Amplify will be used for authentication, backend, and hosting the database. Flutter will utilize the data help in Amplify and present an app with multiple tabs for the user to interact with.
